// expand on those basics and create a more complex example with rotation

This section will cover `<defs>`, `<use>`, and `<g>` by rotating text
around around a point.

we'll need two new properties for our element

```TS
@property({type: Number, attribute: "num-prints"}) numPrints = 7;
@property({
    type: Number,
    attribute: "rotation-offset",
}) rotationOffset = 0;
```

Talk about two new tags

`<defs>` and `<use>` are commonly found together in an SVG document

`<defs` is a special tag that will contain other svg elements but will not
render them. Those elements in `<defs>` can be referenced through
selector ids.

In this case well give our `createChars` svg fragment an id of `#chars`.
Then we'll render it in our `<defs>` element

```HTML
<defs>
    ${createChars(this.chars)}
</defs>
```

Now other svg fragments can reference the chars definition with:

```HTML
<use href="#chars">
```

Well create a series of rotated text by adding

```TS
const prints = [];
let currRotation = offset;
for (let index = 0; index < numPrints; index++) {
    currRotation += rotation;
    prints.push(svg`
        <use href="#chars" transform="rotate(${currRotation}, 0, 0)"></use>
    `);
}
```

Then we'll return our series of text elements as a group. This is helpful
because properties on a group affect all of its descendants.

So a `transform` can move the group of text elements into a more visible
location.
