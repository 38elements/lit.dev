## Introduction

[SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) is a web standard that enables
artists and designers to create beautiful graphics with XML syntax.

But graphics can get complicated!

Document complexity tends to grow with the addition of SVG
requiring additional processing from the DOM. 

Both are supported by all modern browsers.

Where SVG can be composed with styles and templates, Lit
maintains those styles and templates behind a single HTML tag. 
Essentially, Lit encapsulates complex and expensive document
structures like SVG in the shadow DOM.
