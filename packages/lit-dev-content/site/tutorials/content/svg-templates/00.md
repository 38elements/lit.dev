SVG enables artists to create graphics with XML and is supported in all
modern browsers.

But beautiful graphics can get complicated! Document complexity has a
tendency to grow with the addition of SVG, requiring more selectors
and specificity in the DOM. 

Luckily, webcomponents and SVG are a perfect match. Webcomponents can 
encapsulate styles, logic, and document structure inside
a single HTML tag.

This means Lit can ecnapsulate and represent complex document structures 
like SVG in the DOM as a single HTML tag.

After completing this tutorial, the reader will be able to create the
graphic found in this demo. They'll also become more familiar with the
basics of rendering SVG with Lit.
