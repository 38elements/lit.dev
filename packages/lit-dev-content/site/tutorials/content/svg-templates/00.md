SVG enables artists and designers to create beautiful graphics with
XML syntax.

But beautiful graphics can get complicated! Document complexity
has a tendency to grow with the addition of SVG, requiring more elements and selectors from the DOM. 

Luckily, SVG and webcomponents are a perfect fit and both are supported
by all modern browsers.

SVG can be composed with styles, logic, and templates  
Webcomponents can encapsulate styles, logic, and templates 
inside a single HTML tag. 

This means Lit can isoalte complex and expensive document 
structures like SVG in the shadow DOM.

After completing this tutorial, the reader will be able to 
create the graphic found in this demo and become more familiar 
with the basics of rendering SVG with Lit.
