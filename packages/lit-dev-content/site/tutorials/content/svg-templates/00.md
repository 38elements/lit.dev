[SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) is a web standard that enables
artists and designers to create beautiful graphics with XML syntax.

But graphics can get complicated!

Document complexity tends to grow with the addition of SVG
requiring additional processing from the DOM. 

Luckily, SVG and webcomponents are a perfect fit.

Both are supported by all modern browsers.

Where SVG can be composed with styles and templates, Lit can
maintain those styles and templates behind a single HTML tag. 

Essentially, Lit encapsulates complex and expensive document 
structures like SVG in the shadow DOM.

After completing this tutorial, the reader will be able to 
create the graphic found in this demo and become more familiar 
with the basics of rendering SVG with Lit.
