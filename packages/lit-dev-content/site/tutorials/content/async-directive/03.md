Next, get a 3rd-party library for formatting string durations.

The `timeago` npm package accepts a date, and returns a string describing the
time that has elapsed since that date in human-readable form, like "just now" or
"5 minutes ago" or "3 years ago", etc..

Add the package to `package.json`:

```json
  // package.json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "timeago.js": "^4.0.2"
```

Then import the `format` helper into your directive module:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// time-ago.ts
...
import {format} from 'timeago.js';
```

```js
// time-ago.js
...
import {format} from 'timeago.js';
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Last, update the render method to use `format`:

```ts
    return format(time);
```

You should now see the string updated to say "just now". But notice that it
doesn't yet update on its own.

Directives can keep state, operate outside of Lit's lifecycle, and safely access
the DOM.

Unlike regular functions and methods, Directives are made to function outside of
Lit's rendering lifecycle and _asynchronous_ Directives can continue to update
after initial render. See
[Custom directives](/docs/templates/custom-directives/#creating-class-based-directives)
for more details.

</litdev-aside>

In order to make a template helper that keeps the elapsed time up-to-date, the
next steps will show how to use `AsyncDirective` to periodically re-render the
elapsed time asynchronously.
