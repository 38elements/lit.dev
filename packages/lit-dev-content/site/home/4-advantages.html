        Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you
        need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and
        a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job
        easier. Every Lit feature is carefully designed with web platform evolution
        in mind.

        <h2>Fast</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Weighing in at around 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep
        your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is
        lightning-fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI
        when updating–no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.

      <div class="heading">

        <h2>Lit is future-ready</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        By embracing the browser’s native component model, Lit minimizes
        lock-in, maximizes flexibility and promotes maintainability at scale.
        You can update to a major new version of Lit or migrate to another
        Web Components library one component at a time, without disrupting
        product development.

        <h2>Web components</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Every Lit component is a standard web component, with the superpower of
        interoperability. Natively supported by browsers, web components work
        anywhere you use HTML, with any framework or none at all. This makes Lit
        ideal for shareable components or design systems–or use it to build your
        site or app!
